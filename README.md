# Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to create and standardize the _Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium_ to a [Darwin Core checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes) that can be harvested by [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org).

This unified checklist is the result of an open and reproducible data publication and data processing pipeline developed for the [TrIAS project](http://trias-project.be). The data publication pipeline is based on the [Checklist recipe](https://github.com/trias-project/checklist-recipe/wiki) and consists of the publication of a selection of authoritative (inter)national checklists as standardized Darwin Core Archives to [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/network/b153643d-735a-440f-a0e9-428b4f9d1cd2/dataset). These are:

1. [Verloove et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.15468/wtda1m) based on Verloove (2018) for plants
2. [Preda et al. (2019](https://doi.org/10.15468/wr3gis) for birds
3. [Verreycken et al. (2018a)](https://doi.org/10.15468/xvuzfh) based on Verreycken et al. (2018b) for fishes
4. [Boets et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.15468/yxcq07) based on Boets et al. (2016) for macroinvertebrates
5. [Backeljau et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.15468/t13kwo) for terrestrial molluscs
6. [Vanderweyen et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.15468/2dboyn) based on Vanderweyen & Fraiture (2007, 2008, 2011) for rust fungi
7. [Flanders Marine Institute (2019)](https://doi.org/10.14284/347) for marine species
8. [Reyserhove et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.15468/3pmlxs) for various species
9. [Zieritz et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.15468/guejza) based on Zieritz et al. (2017) for pathways.

Predominantly, these checklists record the presence of alien species in Belgium for a specific taxon group or habitat and are maintained by their respective authors. The data processing consists of the extraction of all Belgian non-native taxa from these checklists and the unification of their taxonomy (using the [GBIF Backbone Taxonomy](https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei)) and related information. This automated process is implemented and documented at https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open the RStudio project file
3. Open the `index.Rmd` [R Markdown file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in RStudio
4. Install any required packages
6. Click `Build > Build Book` to generate the processed data and build the website in `docs/`

## Publication

To publish an update of the dataset:

1. Open the [resource in the IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be/manage/resource.do?r=unified-checklist) (login required)
2. `Source data`: upload the newly generated data files from `data/processed`
3. `Darwin Core mappings`: does not require updates, unless terms were added/removed in the pipeline
4. `Metadata`: does not require updates, except for:
    - `Basic metadata`: in description, check if number of taxa (2.500+) still applies
    - `Taxonomic coverage`: in description, update numbers per kingdom based on [new data](https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/6_dwc_mapping.html#preview-data)
    - `Temporal coverage`: update `End date` if need be
5. Publish: click `Publish`, add a short description and publish
6. Check if [dataset is updated](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e) at GBIF (can take a couple of hours)
